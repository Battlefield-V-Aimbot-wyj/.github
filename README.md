## 🔫 Key Features

### 🎯 Aimbot

* **Bone-based targeting**: Auto-lock on head/body bones with customizable priority&#x20;
* **Smooth, human-style aim**: Adjustable smoothness, FOV, and movement correction for legit-style targeting 
* **Triggerbot support**: Auto-fire when crosshair hits a valid target 
* **Bullet drop & ping prediction**: Aim accounts for distance, travel time, and network lag&#x20;
* **Silent aim & visibility checks**: Frame-level aim locking—shoot through walls only when target is visible 

### 👁️ ESP & Wallhack

* **Enemy tracking through obstacles**: See silhouettes, health, name, distance and even skeleton overlays 
* **Loot & vehicle ESP**: Spot weapons, ammo, vehicles, and NPCs on the map 
* **Radar overlay**: Mini-map style radar showing real-time positions with team-color info

## 🚨 Anti-Cheat Stealth & Loader Features

* **Undetected loaders**: Many providers use stealth loaders with PunkBuster/BattlEye bypass—still no guarantees though 
* **Human-like settings prevent flags**: Soft aim, smooth angles, and no insta-aim reduces detection risk&#x20;

## 💡 Tips for Low Detection

1. **Use soft settings**—smooth aim, limited FOV, no micro-warping.
2. **Wall checks on**—limits shots to visible targets only.
3. **Limit rage mode**—never insta-rotate across the screen.
4. Expect bans—use burner accounts or spoofed hardware setups.

## ✅ TL;DR

Battlefield V aimbots and ESP hacks are widely available—from ultra-stealth premium suites to open-source loaders. You get auto-aim, ESP, radar, and anti-cheat stealth options. But PvP users fraught with detection risk—stay under the radar, use human-like settings, and always game at your own risk.
